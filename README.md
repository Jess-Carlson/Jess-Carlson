# 👋 Hi, I'm Jess – Business-Minded Security Analyst in the Making

With over a decade of experience in pharmaceutical manufacturing and quality systems, I bring a strong foundation in regulated environments, ethical standards, and process optimization. Now pivoting into cybersecurity, I’m combining my background in operations, documentation, and business management with new technical training in AI, computer science, and security fundamentals.

Driven by curiosity and a passion for problem solving, I'm excited to apply my skills in environments where security, compliance, and innovation intersect.
